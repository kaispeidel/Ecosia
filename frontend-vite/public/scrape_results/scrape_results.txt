You’ve been signed up to our newsletter. Follow us: Rob Hopkins is the hands-on environmentalist who sparked a global grassroots movement of people determined to make their hometowns better. In his latest book, he shares the secret to building a brighter future: time travel. Rob Hopkins wants you to suspend disbelief. His new book, How to Fall in Love with the Future , begins with an account of his recent journey to the year 2030. “Traveling through time was disorientating the first few times I did it, but I feel as though I’ve got the hang of it now,” writes Hopkins, matter-of-factly. He describes touching down in a world undergoing a “Marshall Plan-scale response” to the climate and ecological crises. He smells the air, listens to the birdsong (which you can hear in the field recordings he brought back), and explores a crisscrossing network of raised walkways connecting rooftop gardens. This is not the picture of the future we’re used to seeing. You only have to glance at the latest news headlines or browse the list of dystopian thrillers on your favorite streaming service, to see that we’ve kind of fallen out of love with the future. The version of 2030 that Hopkins visits is different. Not only is it on its way to being post-fossil fuel, but it’s also post-cynicism. Some folks said it would never work out, future dwellers tell him. But “nobody remembers those people anymore”. READ FULL ARTICLE Beware the imagination-killers Before he was a time traveler, Hopkins started the Transition Towns movement, which grew from its beginnings in the small English town of Totnes to become a worldwide network of grassroots community groups in 50 countries, working to look after their local environment and be more resilient to climate change. All of which is to say: Hopkins is not a crackpot. He knows a thing or two about getting things done. His journeys through time are in fact facilitated group imagination sessions, which he uses to get people to visualize how things could be. When he talks about these trips as if they really happened, it’s because he believes our only chance of getting to a world like this is to leave cynicism behind. To dream big. To suspend disbelief. The book explores Hopkins’ techniques for visualising the future, including instructions for how to ‘build your own time machine’, so anyone can take a group of fellow travelers on an imagination-sparking, cynicism-crushing trip. It also tells the stories of campaigners and community leaders who have succeeded in getting people in their area to imagine how things could be different in five, 10 or 20 years’ time – and used that as a springboard for real change. “We know the things we have to do. What we need is a popular hunger to make those things happen” Hopkins sees humanity’s failure to deal properly with the climate crisis (yet) as a failure of imagination – we just haven’t been able to grasp the scale of the changes required – and what the consequences of action and inaction could be. “We are living in a time which is a kind of perfect storm of factors that are diminishing our ability to see things as if they could be otherwise,” Hopkins tells me, when we meet after an event promoting his book. He repeats this phrase for emphasis: “to see things as if they could be otherwise” . It’s his preferred definition of ‘imagination’. Related articles Your soul is calling. Pick up, says Sarah Wilson Kim Stanley Robinson on the power of climate fiction The “perfect storm” of imagination-killers includes education systems that keep our thinking firmly inside the box; tech platforms designed to suck our precious attention away; precarious economic conditions that don’t give us a moment to breathe, and the mental health effects of… well, all of the above. “In the UK one in four single mothers are avoiding or skipping meals in order to feed their children,” says Hopkins to illustrate the point. “This is not creating the conditions for an imaginative population.” What imagination can do The idea of taking on a challenge as huge as the climate crisis with a bit of imagination, is more grounded than it might sound – and it’s a perspective Hopkins shares with the likes of the activist and writer Rebecca Solnit and the author Amitav Ghosh. “We’re not waiting for any new solutions for the climate emergency,” Hopkins says. “We know all the things that we have to do. What we need is a popular hunger to make those things happen . That means remembering that dealing with climate change isn’t just about cutting carbon. “If we get this right, this is the way to tackle the mental health epidemic, social isolation, loneliness… This is about food and housing and love and art and public luxury and dancing and all of these different things as well.” “The climate emergency demands that we’re able to see things as if they could be otherwise” Photo: James Bannister Of course, imagination isn’t much use without action. But the inverse is also true, says Hopkins. “If all we do is ‘do’ things, and we don’t stop to say, why? What do we do? Where is this going? What’s the goal here? What’s the vision?… then the ‘doing’ is not anywhere near as productive as it could be.” “The climate emergency absolutely demands that we’re able to see things as if they could be otherwise , because the current way that we do most things is profoundly damaging, and the stakes are huge,” he says. Climate scientists have suggested the world needs to go into “emergency mode” – which Hopkins argues is a terrible phrase. “No one’s going to vote for emergency mode,” he says. “The idea that we often are presented with in the climate movement is that if we just give people the right terrifying leaflet or link on YouTube, they’re going to leap from not knowing anything about it to being really involved and really engaged. That very, very rarely happens. We need to talk about the changes that we need to make in ways that are delicious and evoke longing.” Stopping climate change isn’t all about giving things up. The steps we need to take – like making cities greener – can also improve our lives. Photo: Summer Rune / Unsplash Tell us a story This is what Hopkins means when he talks about falling in love with the future, and to do that we need “well-told stories of what’s possible”, he believes. Scientists and activists can help with this, but it’s not typically their forte. “T he cultivation of longing is the skillset of artists, playwrights, street artists, designers, poets, musicians. We can’t do this without those people.” Real-life stories of changes happening right now, elsewhere the world, can also offer enticing visions of what could be. In his book Hopkins writes about visiting a restaurant that runs completely on solar power, a farm that reintroduced beavers to help with water management, a 1970s town that pulled up all its concrete, and a Dutch city where the majority of trips are done by bike. He encourages readers to keep their eyes open for examples like these, as fuel for their own big ideas. Many such stories can be found in Transition Towns, a movement that Hopkins describes as embodying “hope with its sleeves rolled up”. His own hometown of Totnes went as far as minting its own currency to encourage people to spend with local businesses (‘Totnes pounds’ were in circulation for more than a decade until they fell victim to the declining use of cash). It’s an example of people getting together to make a difference for the place they live – and not waiting for leaders to do it for them. Totnes residents also grow food together, cooperate on measures to save energy and work together on measures to make the local economy stronger. The town of Totnes in England introduced its own currency, as a way to support local businesses. Another place that provides a shining example is Liège – a post-industrial town in Belgium with poverty levels above the national average. In 2014 a group of locals came together with a vision: what if the majority of the city’s food were grown locally? A decade on, and the Liège Food Belt is well established. Hundreds of small local producers, making everything from mushrooms to wine, have joined food co-ops which together provide more than 3,000 organic school meals every day. It has taken a lot of hard work to make the food belt a reality. But the crucial ingredient that made it possible was, to use Hopkins’ phrase, seeing things as if they could be different . The instigators of the food belt initiative “never asked for permission”, he points out. “The municipality spent the first three years going, these people are mad, this is never going to work. And then they came to them and said, what you’re doing is incredible, how can we help?” The city has since made it easier for food producers get hold of undeveloped land at low cost – but it was citizens who showed the way. “You see a city reimagining itself, that came from a few citizens sitting around the table saying, so should we do it? Yes, let’s do it. Now that model has spread to six other cities in Belgium. I think by 2030 it will be the new normal for cities across Europe.” If more of us get together in the same “let’s do it” spirit, then the version of 2030 that Hopkins paid a trip to, feels within reach. So one last question: if Hopkins could travel to any point in time… where (or rather when) would he go? After a long pause, he says he’d like to meet Songtsen Gampo, the king who brought Buddhism to Tibet and turned it from a warring nation to a “kind of Silicon Valley of meditation and compassion research. And then, of course I’d love to go and see the Velvet Underground playing in 1968 at the Boston Tea Party.” What about the future? “The future is not a fixed thing. There are many, many, many different quantum threads that stretch from the present off to many different futures,” says Hopkins, back in character as Time Traveler. “So when you say, where would I go in the future, it’s like… which future?” Did this inspire you?

All News World Arts & Leisure Design Firm Blends New Tourist Infrastructure into the Very Rock of this Famous Taiwan Geopark By Andy Corbley - Sep 2, 2025 The approach to Nature Rocks – credit, MVRDC © A Dutch architecture and design firm has renovated the infrastructure in a famous geopark, converting the bland and grating modernity into a nature-inspired welcome mat. Jialeshui is a well-known scenic area in the southernmost part of Taiwan, known for its remarkable rock formations shaped by wind and water in Pingtung county. The local government recently selected the design proposal submitted by MVRDV together with HWC Architects that was based around a series of key structures and paths that take the rocks themselves as inspiration. Called Nature Rocks, MVDRV designed a network of new pathways and public spaces that improve accessibility while seamlessly blending into the rocky environment. Over thousands of years, strong winds and sea waves have shaped the area’s soft sandstone coastline into a series of sculptural rock formations, many of which resemble animals and carry names such as Rabbit Rock, Toad Rock, and Seal Rock. Currently, the forest just behind is separated from the rocky shoreline by a single road that cuts through the landscape—a narrow, largely straight route shared by shuttle buses, pedestrians, and cyclists. The pavilions and kiosks peppered along the road have been damaged by typhoons and seawater, and the whole ensemble looked exploitative and a bit ramshackle. “What you see today at Jialeshui shows a clear boundary between the natural and the artificial; in turn, this artificial trail separates nature from itself, separating forest from coastline”, says MVRDV founding partner Winy Maas. “Our goal was never to impose architecture on the landscape, but to let it emerge from the natural conditions; to break the monotony of the straight line… and to emphasize that Nature Rocks!” The Nature Rocks Trail and infrastructure – credit, MVRDC © All of the new construction will be confined to areas that are already developed to avoid disrupting the original natural landscape.

Focused Text: A Dutch architecture and design firm has renovated the infrastructure in a famous geopark, converting the bland and grating modernity into a nature-inspired welcome mat. Jialeshui is a well-known scenic area in the southernmost part of Taiwan, known for its remarkable rock formations shaped by wind and water in Pingtung county. The local government recently selected the design proposal submitted by MVRDV together with HWC Architects that was based around a series of key structures and paths that take the rocks themselves as inspiration. Called Nature Rocks, MVDRV designed a network of new pathways and public spaces that improve accessibility while seamlessly blending into the rocky environment. Over thousands of years, strong winds and sea waves have shaped the area’s soft sandstone coastline into a series of sculptural rock formations, many of which resemble animals and carry names such as Rabbit Rock, Toad Rock, and Seal Rock. Currently, the forest just behind is separated from the rocky shoreline by a single road that cuts through the landscape—a narrow, largely straight route shared by shuttle buses, pedestrians, and cyclists. The pavilions and kiosks peppered along the road have been damaged by typhoons and seawater, and the whole ensemble looked exploitative and a bit ramshackle. “What you see today at Jialeshui shows a clear boundary between the natural and the artificial; in turn, this artificial trail separates nature from itself, separating forest from coastline”, says MVRDV founding partner Winy Maas. “Our goal was never to impose architecture on the landscape, but to let it emerge from the natural conditions; to break the monotony of the straight line… and to emphasize that Nature Rocks!” All of the new construction will be confined to areas that are already developed to avoid disrupting the original natural landscape. Inspired by the layered forms of the coastline, the design breaks up the existing straight road and reimagines recreational pathways as a cracked, rocky, naturalistic landscape that stitches the forest and the coastline back together.

On an electric-powered journey from Sydney to Byron Bay, she stops for surf, SUP-adventures and lessons from the land. When the paperbark tree blossoms, it means the mullet fish are running up the creek from colder waters. When the tree bark sheds, it means sharks are prevalent in the deep ocean. “We’re saltwater, freshwater people. We’ve got a lot of relations with the fish and plants that coincide with the water,” says our stand-up paddle boarding guide, Gumbaynggirr and Yirrganydji man, Ronan Singleton. Though I’ve called Eora/Sydney home for most of my adult life, there are many sections of Australia’s famed east coast that I’ve never explored. And many things, like the traditional Indigenous uses of the paperbark tree, that I never learned. Until now. I’m back in Australia—after living abroad in Canada—and hitting the road in the new all-electric Jeep Avenger with my surf-obsessed friend Ari Halder to learn more about the coast and Country. The chosen route: Gadigal land (Sydney) all the way up to Bundjalung country (Byron Bay), stopping for surf, SUP’ing and sleeping at EV-friendly Reflections Holidays along the way. Top: The coastal drive from Sydney to Byron Bay is roughly 470 miles (750 kilometers) through diverse landscapes with epic ocean views; Middle: Ari packs the Avenger, which has roomy boot space, a wireless infotainment dashboard and 250 mile (400 kilometer) range; Bottom: Each night Ari and writer Emily bunk down at EV-friendly Reflections Holidays. Photos: Paul Lojszczyk Gadigal land to Worimi Country | Sydney to Tuncurry The weather is not exactly ideal—the region’s been flooding and even now, it’s raining. But ever the optimists, we pack our swimmers and a surfboard into the charged EV and hit the road, keen for that post-storm swell. We’re connected to the Avenger’s infotainment in an instant, so it’s maps at the ready, music pumping and high vibes. Three hours north of the city, the Lakes Way scenic drive—stretching between Buladelah and Tuncurry—is more than scenic. For the unoriented, picture towering eucalyptus above winding roads, and cabbage tree palms and ferns coating the damp forest floor. Birds chirp animatedly. I’m impressed by how much grip and control we have as we cruise the tight bends. We’re on the traditional lands of the Worimi Nation, made up of 18 tribes whose lands span inland to the coast. We didn’t want to camp on this road trip, but hotels feel too removed from local life. My timber-lined cabin, surrounded by succulents, is the best of both worlds: Comfortable, but close to nature. After washing off the drive and the salt water, I have one of my best night’s sleep in ages, listening to the soundtrack of waves. Beyond the dense forests, we’re greeted by the glistening Wallis Lake, an estuary spanning 16 miles (25 kilometers). As we cross a skinny isthmus, with the lake to our left and the Tasman Sea to our right, I gape at the expanse in both directions. I picture the Worimi people gathering shellfish and fishing for mullet in their waters—a staple food source through the seasons for Indigenous communities up and down the coast, I’m learning. We’ve already traced a beach-to-rainforest hiking trail in Booti Booti National Park just kilometers before. Daan.gaari/ Tuncurry is our final destination today. We arrive for a night at Reflections, one of eight parks along the NSW east coast newly kitted out with EV-charging stations. Very convenient. The charger is even close to our cabin front door—even more convenient. With the epic Nine-Mile Beach just 160 yards (150 meters) walk ahead, our evening location can only be improved by grabbing local fish and chips for dinner. EV charging tip: The Jeep Avenger has a 240-mile (390-kilometer) range but highway driving uses a little more power than you might expect, so use the Evie or Chargefox app to find your nearest EV-charging station along the way. There are plenty around Newcastle. Then charge overnight at Tuncurry. Top: Ari goes surfing right out front of the Reflections Holidays Bonny Hills park; Middle: Cooking up a feast at an on-site park kitchen can be just as fun, but more comfortable than camping; Bottom: The color of the Avenger against the forest is stunning. Photos: Paul Lojszczyk Worimi Country to Birpai Country | Tuncurry to Bonny Hills Our destination today is Bonny Hills, just an hour’s drive north. But a short drive doesn’t mean there’s less to do. Gazing at long stretches of rugged coastline brings down the tempo of any given day, and you can slow it down even further by stopping at Crowdy Bay National Park to check out its vast golden sand beaches and scrubby headland walking loops. Opening the Avenger’s sun roof to experience the silence of driving an EV is a must. Bonny Hills’ verdant seaside landscape is the traditional lands of the Birpai people, an area rich with littoral rainforests, brahminy kite birds, eagles and fish. Lobsters, oysters and pipis were traditionally eaten here, while crab is a sacred salt water totem (spiritual emblem). What was once an undisturbed coast—as Birpai people settled in small villages along rivers and lakes—became decorated with wooden fishing shacks for local fishing enthusiasts in the 1940s, and is now home to large beach houses that shelter Bonny Hills’ small but tight-knit community.  Still, there’s only one pub, a couple of cafés, and a whole lot of chill. Related Is Jeep’s first EV the perfect partner for your low-emissions adventures? We put it to the test The ocean bellows directly below the headland, and a walking trail from the Reflections Holidays Bonny Hills park—our stay for the night—provides easy access to Rainbow Beach and continues along the coast to Port Macquarie. “It’s absolutely cooking!” yells Ari as the exposed point break comes into view and the sun peeks through. Stoked on the clear conditions and a beach less crowded than his Sydney local, Ari’s got his board out of the roomy boot and his wetsuit on before I’ve turned the car off. Turns out the Bonny Hills secret is good swell. We didn’t want to camp on this road trip, but hotels feel too removed from local life. My sleek, timber-lined cabin , surrounded by succulents, is the best of both worlds: Comfortable, but close to nature. After washing off the drive and the salt water, I have one of my best night’s sleep in ages, listening to the soundtrack of waves. EV charging tip: Reflections Bonny Hills’ EV charging station is available from 9am til 5pm, so stay a little longer to make the most of the facilities and locale. A SUP adventure with the Wajaana Yaam team journeys up Moonee Creek on the Coffs Coast, the traditional lands of the Gumbaynggirr people. The region is home to all types of mangroves and many bird species. Photos: Paul Lojszczyk Birpai and Gumbaynggirr Country to Bundjalung Country | Bonny Hills to Evans Head “Giinigay” (hello) says Ronan as he hands me a paddle and a soft paperbark leaf, inviting me to breathe in its eucalyptus scent. It’s immediately calming. We’re embarking on a Wajaana Yaam SUP adventure up Moonee Creek on the Coffs Coast, the traditional land of the Gumbaynggirr people. As we push from the shore and start paddling, Ronan points out various bird species—eastern osprey and white-belly sea eagles are common—plus all the types of mangroves. After the recent flooding, the mangroves’ important role in filtering dirty water and preventing soil erosion is even more apparent. And when I notice the way the tides flow in and out of their webbed and winding roots, how the mud crabs bunker down in the soil nearby, how mangrove jacks and estuary codfish flutter near the banks, I can’t help but appreciate the incredible ecosystem they foster. “[Our culture] has been beaten in the past, and you know, we’re just trying to revitalize it, and the best way to do it is to share it.” - Ronan Singleton, Guide “Nothing wrong with a bit of mud between the toes,” Ronan says, as we walk barefoot in the squelchy, soft slush between these aerating plants. “People pay a lot of money for this stuff.” The Gumbaynggirr language was in danger of being totally lost after the Stolen Generation, a multi-generational period (1910-1970s) where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were forcibly removed from their families by the Australian federal and state governments. But in the last 10 years, there has been a concerted  effort to bring it back.  Wajaana Yaam’s owner Clark Webb established a school for local Aboriginal youth, where Ronan also teaches; and a portion of the SUP tour’s profits go to language programs and camps, among other initiatives, via the Bularri Muurlay Nyanggan Aboriginal Corporation (BMNAC). Top: Guide and Gumbaynggirr and Yirrganydji man Ronan Singleton shares cultural stories on his SUP tours of the Coffs Coast; Middle: Reflections Holidays parks along east coast NSW are outfitted with EV charging stations, making it easy to keep the Avenger juiced up; Bottom: Reflections Holidays Evans Head is situated on the banks of the picturesque Evans River. Photos: Paul Lojszczyk “[Our culture] has been beaten in the past, and you know, we’re just trying to revitalize it, and the best way to do it is to share it,” says Ronan. A culture that is so welcoming and giving is one definitely worth sharing in, and this gives me hope that Australia’s future will better celebrate Indigenous knowledge and community. Back in the car, I turn on the EV’s heated seats to warm up after being in the water. We’re less than two hours away from Reflections Evans Head. This stretch offers countless beaches and sleepy villages, accessed via single roads through a slew of coastal nature reserves and the mighty Yuraygir, Bundjalung and Broadwater National Parks. Related How Byron Bay should be seen: With an Indigenous Elder Tonight, we’re staying on the banks of the Evans River, which meets the ocean. It’s dusk and it’s time to eat. As we heat up the barbecue on our spacious villa ’s deck, perfect for al fresco dining, I notice a pod of pelicans congregating in the estuary to fish together. Are they reflecting on what they learned today, too? As the sun drops down they all slowly flock away; and everything is quiet, save for the ebb of the water and the hushed sounds of nearby campers settling in for the night. EV charging tip: It’s worth stopping in Coffs Harbour en route for a quick charge and a snack. Reflections Evans Head has two charging stations to be easily utilized overnight. Top: Test-driving the Jeep Avenger’s all-terrain function in wet weather; Middle: Ari checks out the Evans Head surf conditions; Bottom: Mango and macadamia smoothies are a menu highlight at WOODS Bangalow. Photos: Paul Lojszczyk Bundjalung Country | Evans Head to Byron Bay A short early morning walk into Evans Head township shows me the friendly, warm nature of the place. I can’t resist checking out Sunnyboy —part-coffee shop, part-retail store, with delicious baked  treats. As I’m reveling over an unbelievable spinach and feta scroll, the owner points out a woman sitting inside who does a lot of the baking. I want to tell her how incredible the pastries are, but I don’t need to—the line out the door says it all. As we check out the surf by the North Break Wall, everyone who passes us says hello. “No-one says hi like this in the city,” Ari comments. We’re certainly not in Sydney anymore. We’re keen to spin the Avenger on the hills again, so we take a short drive through a river crossing, arched gnarled trees and farmland to visit Killen Falls. From a platform overlooking the raucous cascade, we gaze up to the sprawling canopy and down at the moss-laden rocks by the pool below. The surf’s not up, so we head inland for adventure. Beyond the famous beaches of Byron Bay, the Northern Rivers hinterland is known for its undulating pastures and locally grown produce. Brunch is at WOODS in Bangalow, a town that’s equal parts artsy, laid-back community and world-class dining and fashion. The café’s menu is interwoven with locally sourced ingredients—Ari opts for Turkish-style eggs with Byron Bay halloumi, creamy tahini whipped yoghurt and Sequel sourdough (also made in Byron), with a mango and macadamia smoothie, and I tuck into a nourishing ‘harvest hinterland plate’: Miso gochujang mushrooms, poached eggs, avocado, herby salad. Rain pours as we sit sheltered next to folks selling jewellery, art and clothes in converted shipping containers. Killen Falls, in Tintenbar, is home to one of the last standing remnants of the big scrub rainforest, which once blanketed the entire Northern Rivers region.

From a platform overlooking the raucous cascade, we gaze up to the sprawling canopy and down at the moss-laden rocks by the pool below. On a warmer day, I’d take a dip in those waters, but today, it’s enough to cautiously move behind the veil of the falls to feel its rupture. The spray on my skin and the overwhelming sound drowns out all else, and I can’t stop my grin despite my now soaking trousers. Though floodplains deterred us, this trip has reminded me how beautiful home can be at any time of year.  When the sun breaks through, it’s blissful. But even without it, this 470-mile (750-kilometer) journey has shown me not only the ease of EV travel, but how resilient, adaptive and diverse the east coast landscape and its deep-rooted communities are.

It’s immediately calming. We’re embarking on a Wajaana Yaam SUP adventure up Moonee Creek on the Coffs Coast, the traditional land of the Gumbaynggirr people. As we push from the shore and start paddling, Ronan points out various bird species—eastern osprey and white-belly sea eagles are common—plus all the types of mangroves. After the recent flooding, the mangroves’ important role in filtering dirty water and preventing soil erosion is even more apparent. And when I notice the way the tides flow in and out of their webbed and winding roots, how the mud crabs bunker down in the soil nearby, how mangrove jacks and estuary codfish flutter near the banks, I can’t help but appreciate the incredible ecosystem they foster. “[Our culture] has been beaten in the past, and you know, we’re just trying to revitalize it, and the best way to do it is to share it.” - Ronan Singleton, Guide “Nothing wrong with a bit of mud between the toes,” Ronan says, as we walk barefoot in the squelchy, soft slush between these aerating plants. “People pay a lot of money for this stuff.” The Gumbaynggirr language was in danger of being totally lost after the Stolen Generation, a multi-generational period (1910-1970s) where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were forcibly removed from their families by the Australian federal and state governments. But in the last 10 years, there has been a concerted  effort to bring it back.  Wajaana Yaam’s owner Clark Webb established a school for local Aboriginal youth, where Ronan also teaches; and a portion of the SUP tour’s profits go to language programs and camps, among other initiatives, via the Bularri Muurlay Nyanggan Aboriginal Corporation (BMNAC). “[Our culture] has been beaten in the past, and you know, we’re just trying to revitalize it, and the best way to do it is to share it,” says Ronan. A culture that is so welcoming and giving is one definitely worth sharing in, and this gives me hope that Australia’s future will better celebrate Indigenous knowledge and community. Back in the car, I turn on the EV’s heated seats to warm up after being in the water. We’re less than two hours away from Reflections Evans Head. This stretch offers countless beaches and sleepy villages, accessed via single roads through a slew of coastal nature reserves and the mighty Yuraygir, Bundjalung and Broadwater National Parks. Tonight, we’re staying on the banks of the Evans River, which meets the ocean. It’s dusk and it’s time to eat. As we heat up the barbecue on our spacious villa ’s deck, perfect for al fresco dining, I notice a pod of pelicans congregating in the estuary to fish together. Are they reflecting on what they learned today, too? As the sun drops down they all slowly flock away; and everything is quiet, save for the ebb of the water and the hushed sounds of nearby campers settling in for the night. EV charging tip: It’s worth stopping in Coffs Harbour en route for a quick charge and a snack. Reflections Evans Head has two charging stations to be easily utilized overnight. A short early morning walk into Evans Head township shows me the friendly, warm nature of the place. I can’t resist checking out Sunnyboy —part-coffee shop, part-retail store, with delicious baked  treats. As I’m reveling over an unbelievable spinach and feta scroll, the owner points out a woman sitting inside who does a lot of the baking. I want to tell her how incredible the pastries are, but I don’t need to—the line out the door says it all. As we check out the surf by the North Break Wall, everyone who passes us says hello. “No-one says hi like this in the city,” Ari comments. We’re certainly not in Sydney anymore. We’re keen to spin the Avenger on the hills again, so we take a short drive through a river crossing, arched gnarled trees and farmland to visit Killen Falls. From a platform overlooking the raucous cascade, we gaze up to the sprawling canopy and down at the moss-laden rocks by the pool below. The surf’s not up, so we head inland for adventure. Beyond the famous beaches of Byron Bay, the Northern Rivers hinterland is known for its undulating pastures and locally grown produce. Brunch is at WOODS in Bangalow, a town that’s equal parts artsy, laid-back community and world-class dining and fashion. The café’s menu is interwoven with locally sourced ingredients—Ari opts for Turkish-style eggs with Byron Bay halloumi, creamy tahini whipped yoghurt and Sequel sourdough (also made in Byron), with a mango and macadamia smoothie, and I tuck into a nourishing ‘harvest hinterland plate’: Miso gochujang mushrooms, poached eggs, avocado, herby salad. Rain pours as we sit sheltered next to folks selling jewellery, art and clothes in converted shipping containers.

From a platform overlooking the raucous cascade, we gaze up to the sprawling canopy and down at the moss-laden rocks by the pool below. On a warmer day, I’d take a dip in those waters, but today, it’s enough to cautiously move behind the veil of the falls to feel its rupture. The spray on my skin and the overwhelming sound drowns out all else, and I can’t stop my grin despite my now soaking trousers. Though floodplains deterred us, this trip has reminded me how beautiful home can be at any time of year.  When the sun breaks through, it’s blissful. But even without it, this 470-mile (750-kilometer) journey has shown me not only the ease of EV travel, but how resilient, adaptive and diverse the east coast landscape and its deep-rooted communities are.
